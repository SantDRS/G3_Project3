The Proposal: To build an interactive wine pairing dashboard 

The Scope: Using the api.sampleapis.com wine data and a wine pairing list we will 
create a dashboard that visually recommends a wine pairing based a user’s dish of 
choice. 

The Purpose: The dashboard is intended to house a virtual catalog of wines from 
around the world that are filtered back to the client based on their dish of choice to help 
find the best wine selection for their dish.


-----Working Data:
-----Data Source:
ohttps://api.sampleapis.com/wines/reds
ohttps://api.sampleapis.com/wines/whites
ohttps://api.sampleapis.com/wines/sparkling
ohttps://api.sampleapis.com/wines/rose

ohttps://api.sampleapis.com/wines/dessert
https://www.newsweek.com/amplify/30-fascinating-facts-about-wine-that-you-never-knew
Self-built wine pairing list


-----Questions we’ll ask of the data for our dashboard:
What type of dish will you be eating?
What varietal will you be choosing?

-----To provide:
-Wine type recommendation (red/white/rose/sparkling/port/dessert)
-Wine Variety recommendation
--This will require a regex on the wine name to create list of wine 
varieties (Cabernet, Riesling, etc)
-Display top 5 wines in that wine type


-----Analysis and visualization shall include 
-Python Flask-powered API, 
-HTML/CSS, 
-JavaScript, 
-MongoDB, 
----- Visualizations: 
-Dropdown List for user to choose their dish
*Dish Choice
-Charts
*Chart Visualization to show Top 5 wines based on user dish type
*Pie Chart showing a breakdown of wine varieties by wine type
*bar chart showing the countries the wines come from
*Wine Recommendation Drop Down List based on user dish choice
